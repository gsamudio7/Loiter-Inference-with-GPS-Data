	abstract = {Multi-gigabyte data sets challenge and frustrate R users even on well-equipped hardware. C/C++ and Fortran programming can be helpful, but is cumbersome for interactive data analysis and lacks the flexibility and power of R{\textquoteright}s rich statistical programming environment. The new package bigmemory bridges this gap, implementing massive matrices in memory (managed in R but implemented in C++) and supporting their basic manipulation and exploration. It is ideal for problems involving the analysis in R of manageable subsets of the data, or when an analysis is conducted mostly in C++. In a Unix environment, the data structure may be allocated to shared memory with transparent read and write locking, allowing separate processes on the same computer to share access to a single copy of the data set. This opens the door for more powerful parallel analyses and data mining of massive data sets.},
