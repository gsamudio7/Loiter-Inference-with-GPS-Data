	abstract = {Mammalian predators encounter unique hunting challenges during the winter as snow increases the cost of locomotion and influences predator-prey interactions. Winter precipitation may also affect predators’ ability to detect and pursue prey. We investigated the effects of snowfall events on grey wolves (Canis lupus) in a boreal forest ecosystem in northeastern Alberta, Canada. We predicted that wolves would respond to snowfall events by reducing their travel speed and the time they spent travelling. Over the course of two winters, we used remote cameras to identify localized snowfall events and estimate snow depth. We used telemetry data from 17 wolves to calculate travel speed and time spent travelling versus resting. Data were categorized by time of day (night versus day) and time since snowfall events, and analyzed using linear and logistic regression mixed-effects models. We found that wolves were less likely to travel on dates of snowfall events than any date prior to or after an event. Wolves also travelled slower during snowfall events, but only when compared to their travel speed 24 hours before. Effects were most pronounced at night, when movements appeared to be consistent with hunting behavior, and activity levels resumed within 24 hours of a snowfall event. Including snow depth as a variable did not improve model fit. Collectively, our findings suggest that wolves’ response is not driven by increased hunting success or by energetic considerations resulting from increased snow depth. Instead, we propose that wolves reduce their activity levels because precipitation dampens hunting success. Snowfall events may impact wolves’ ability to detect prey and changes in prey behavior could also lead to decreased encounter rates. We encourage scientists to further investigate the effects of short-term weather events on movement rates and predator-prey interactions.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the Wildlife Effectiveness and Connectivity (WHEC) program was to consider the overall efficacy of setbacks for corridors as a conservation tool and make recommendations on appropriate widths. We determined the function and importance of the Athabasca River and its main tributaries as corridors for wildlife in the Athabasca Oil Sands region. Moose and wolves were selected for detailed study using GPS collar technology and this was augmented with a multi-year camera trapping program to assess use near mines and in river valleys by a wider range of mammal species. At present, there is no indication that the pattern of mines on the landscape has led to some wildlife populations being isolated because continuous accessible habitat exists to the east and west of the mines that allow populations to remain contiguous. There is also no indication that river valleys in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region do not represent natural corridors for mammal species in the region. We have made a strong scientific case for abandoning the designation of setback distances from the Athabasca River and its main tributaries as an important conservation tool in the Oil Sands Region. There may be important reasons to limit how close to rivers mining can occur but there is no scientific case for these limitations being set on the basis of maintaining river valleys as important habitat corridors for wildlife. Recommendations of appropriate setback distances would not be appropriate given their limited utility as a conservation tool in this circumstance.},

	abstract = {Human disturbance can alter predation rates to prey in various ways. Predators can use human disturbance to facilitate hunting, thereby increasing exposure to prey. Conversely, when predators avoid human disturbance and prey do not, prey refugia are generated. Because the direction and magnitude of such effects are not always predictable, it is important to examine if and how predation rates vary with human disturbance. Alberta's Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) is a region of boreal forest characterized by extensive human disturbance and is home to moose (Alces alces) and wolf (Canis lupus) populations. We examined whether the wolf predation rate of moose varies with human disturbance in the AOSR. We compared the distribution of wolf kills of moose to a spatial index of moose density in uplands and wetlands, near and far from rivers, mines and facilities, and at high and low densities of linear features near human habitation. Moose were killed closer to mines and rivers and at lower densities of linear features than expected by random. When compared to the relative availability of habitats, more kills of moose occurred in upland forest than in wetlands. However, when compared to the relative density of moose, kills only increased with decreasing distance to mines and rivers. We conclude that predation rates of moose have increased near human disturbance in AOSR because the mining footprint has removed habitat causing changes to the intensity of wolf use of areas near the boundary of mines. We discuss possibility of sink habitat near mining features and whether that is expected to reduce moose population density across AOSR.},

Two issues are difficult to deal with by the traditional density-based algorithms, i. e. multiple stops at the same spatial location with different visit times and non-consecutive point sequence for stop definition due to signal drifting. This article aims to develop a modified density-based clustering algorithm, named T-{DBSCAN}, by considering the timesequential characteristics of the {GPS} points along a trajectory. Two new premises (i.e. state continuity within a single stop and temporal disjuncture among stops) were proposed as a theoretical basis for regulating the trajectory point selection in clustering. An empirical test was performed using a {GPS}-based personal travel dataset collected in the city of Shanghai to compare T-{DBSCAN} against {DBSCAN}. The results indicated that T-{DBSCAN} effectively improved both accuracy and computational speed in trajectory segmentation.},

	doi = {10.1145/2733381},
	abstract = {An integrated framework for density-based cluster analysis, outlier detection, and data visualization is introduced in this article. The main module consists of an algorithm to compute hierarchical estimates of the level sets of a density, following Hartigan’s classic model of density-contour clusters and trees. Such an algorithm generalizes and improves existing density-based clustering techniques with respect to different aspects. It provides as a result a complete clustering hierarchy composed of all possible density-based clusters following the nonparametric model adopted, for an infinite range of density thresholds. The resulting hierarchy can be easily processed so as to provide multiple ways for data visualization and exploration. It can also be further postprocessed so that: (i) a normalized score of “outlierness” can be assigned to each data object, which unifies both the global and local perspectives of outliers into a single definition; and (ii) a “flat” (i.e., nonhierarchical) clustering solution composed of clusters extracted from local cuts through the cluster tree (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds) can be obtained, either in an unsupervised or in a semisupervised way. In the unsupervised scenario, the algorithm corresponding to this postprocessing module provides a global, optimal solution to the formal problem of maximizing the overall stability of the extracted clusters. If partially labeled objects or instance-level constraints are provided by the user, the algorithm can solve the problem by considering both constraints violations/satisfactions and cluster stability criteria. An asymptotic complexity analysis, both in terms of running time and memory space, is described. Experiments are reported that involve a variety of synthetic and real datasets, including comparisons with state-of-the-art, density-based clustering and (global and local) outlier detection methods.},

	abstract = {Clustering is an essential data mining tool that aims to discover inherent cluster structure in data. For most applications, applying clustering is only appropriate when cluster structure is present. As such, the study of clusterability, which evaluates whether data possesses such structure, is an integral part of cluster analysis. However, methods for evaluating clusterability vary radically, making it challenging to select a suitable measure. In this paper, we perform an extensive comparison of measures of clusterability and provide guidelines that clustering users can reference to select suitable measures for their applications.},

	abstract = {The method depends on linear measurements between random points and adjacent individuals, and between adjacent pairs of individuals. Its results compare favourably with those of the current methods when tested on synthetic and natural populations. The method is quicker than the quadrat methods and is especially useful for analysing the distribution of trees.},
